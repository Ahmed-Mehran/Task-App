#### DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION


## WE WILL NOW HEAD ONTO OUR SETTINGS.PY AND AT THE TOP, WE WILL SET DEBUG = FALSE. ITS BETTER TO SET IT TO FALSE, WHEN IN YOUR SITE IS READY FOR PRODUCTION
## AND THEN IN ALLOWED_HOST, SET IT TO ['*'], IT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONNECT ACCORDINGLY TO DIFFEENT SEVERS WITHOUT ANY ISSUES

DEBUG = False

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']

## NOW WE WILL CREATE A VARIABLE KNOWN AS CSRF, RIGHT UNDER ALLOWED_HOSTS, THIS VARIABLE WILL ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE POST REQUEST WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS 
## WHATSOEVER FROM OUR DOMAIN NAME

CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = []  ## WE WILL COMMENT IT OUT FOR NOW, WE COMMENT IT FOR NOW, BECAUSE WE NEED TO ADD IN THE DOMAIN NAME THAT GETS GENERATED FOR US BY RENDER
                           ## AND AT THIS POINT WE HAVENT GENERATED ANY DOMAIN NAME FOR US, THAT IS WHY COMMENTING IT OUT
