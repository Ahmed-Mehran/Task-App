###   IAM -- GENERATE ACCESS KEYS

# WE NEED ACCESS KEYS BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY DOWN THE LINE, WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE STORE OUR STATIC FILES(THE CSS, JS FILES AND ALSO CAN BE MEDIA FILES)
# AND RUN THEM IN PRODUCTION MODE. AND TO DO SO WE ARE GOING TO USE THE AMAZON S3 BUCKET, WHICH IS GOING TO STORE AND ALLOW US TO RENDER STATIC FILES FROM 
# AMAZON S3 BUCKET. SO IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THIS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR DJANGO APPLICATION AND AWS S3 SERVICE, SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE CREATE BUCKETS, WE 
# NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ACCESS KEYS

# NOW TO CREATE ACCES KEYS, CLICK AND USERS IN IAM, THEN ON SECURITY CREDENTIALS, THEN CLICK ON CREATE ACCESS AND FROM USE CASE SELECT local code,
# BECAUSE we plan to use this access key to enable application code in a local development environment to access your AWS account. 
# AN ACCESS KEY WILL BE GENERATED AND SAVE THAT(SAVED IN NOTES)
